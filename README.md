# python3_turing_machine
Hi, Im Maciek and this is my turing machine engine I made it from scrach, because i had to work with turing machine algorithms and i wanted to see how it looks like. I think the biggest problem with other turing machines engines is that they are not prepered to use more then one word in turing machine meaning and you can get it in for another time. Also the creating algorithm is not very clearly in other projects.

This is actualy working graete on one world per run time. Still working to make it beter for more then one world!!!
